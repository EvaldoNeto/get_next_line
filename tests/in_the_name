	"In The Name"

Across the desert, through the plaines
Freedom riders, in anger they came
Under cover o' prophets
And the words of the saints
Doin' all for the justice
Doin' all for the gain

Anytime, anywhere
The fighting goes on
Anytime, anyday
See those lives get blown away

In the name, in the name of some god
They're fighting for nothing
Spilling their blood
In the name, in the name of a sin
All running for cover
In a fight they can't win

Unhold is the promise
You're leavin' to die
On the gates of eden
You can't tell no lie
Hear the moarns of the young ones
Left out in pain
It's the law of the strong ones
Who's leading the bane

Anytime, anywhere
The fighting goes on
Anytime, anyday
See those lives get blown away

In the name, in the name of some god
They're fighting for nothing
Spilling their blood
In the name, in the name of a sin
All running for cover
In a fight they can't win
