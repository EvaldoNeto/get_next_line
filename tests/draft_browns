Brown once sat, and now Alonzo Highsmith coming over from Green Bay. Those two, and the rest of the FO, will still benefit from the moves made by Brown to add numerous important Draft assets to the team.

As of today, the Browns own 5 extra picks in the upcoming Draft while also possessing their own in every round. Their additional picks fall in the following rounds:

1st Round - Texans
2nd Round - Texans & Eagles
4th Round - Panthers
5th Round - Chiefs

Based on the regular season, we know the numbers of the team's first 4 picks but after that it depends on the results of the NFL Playoffs as well as Compensatory Picks. We will try to give you a good guess as to where the Browns will be picking in each round here:

(* = estimate/guess)

Round 1

#1 - Own Pick
#4 - Texans Pick

Round 2

#33 - Own Pick
#35 - Texans Pick - Due to tie with the Colts, the Texans and Colts will flip picks every round. Colts got #3 overall due to the Strength of Schedule tiebreaker so Texans get the higher pick in the 2nd, 4th & 6th Rounds
#60 - *Eagles Pick - This pick won't be decided until the Eagles lose. This predicts they lose their first game, in the Divisional Round, but due to them holding the best record in the league (tied) they get the lowest of those picks. If the other three 13 win teams all lose, unlikely, this pick would #58.
